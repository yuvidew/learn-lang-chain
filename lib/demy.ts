### Contract Overview
This document is an employment offer letter from Riverhouse Technologies to Mr. Yuvraj Dewangan for the position of Software Development Intern in Bhilai. The letter outlines the key terms of the internship, including a monthly stipend of Rs 9,000/-, the duration of 6 months, working hours, annual leave entitlement (15 days), and the potential for conversion to a full-time position based on performance. It also mentions future inclusion of PF & ESIC deductions once relevant policies are implemented. The letter is signed by Sabana, Sr. HR Manager of Riverhouse Technologies.

### Summary
This offer letter formally extends an internship opportunity to Mr. Yuvraj Dewangan, detailing the primary compensation, work schedule, and the performance-based pathway to full-time employment. While it establishes the basic framework of the internship, it lacks specific clauses regarding termination procedures, intellectual property, confidentiality, or dispute resolution, which are common in more comprehensive employment agreements. The contingent nature of full-time conversion and the future implementation of PF & ESIC deductions represent key points of interest and potential risks for the intern.`
